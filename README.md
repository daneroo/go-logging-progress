# Logging and Progress

Just to show:

- How to use logrus properly
- How to use progress bars
    - [Simple pb](https://github.com/cheggaaa/pb)
    - [multibar](https://github.com/sethgrid/multibar)

## Questions:

- How should logrus config be centralized (should it?)
- Fix the final output of pb (bad spacing)
- pb's rate calculation is always global

## Notes
Simple `pb` is vendored in through gopkg.in. It's README says: `go get gopkg.in/cheggaaa/pb.v1`
